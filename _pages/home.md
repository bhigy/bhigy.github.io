I am a machine learning scientist at [Ava](ava.me).

My work focuses on speech and language technology for live captioning for accessibility.
I am generaly interested in computational language learning from speech with a particular emphasis on weakly supervised learning.
I am also interested in interpretability of deep neural networks and  computational modeling of lanugage processing/acquisition by humans.

* ** 15th of April 2022**:
I am officialy joining [Ava](ava.me) to help them improve their speech-to-text technology üéâ. Very excited to work on improving accessibility for deaf and hard-of-hearing people! ‚ù§Ô∏è

* **11th November 2021:**
I will present a poster at the [BlackboxNLP workshop](https://blackboxnlp.github.io) about our recent work on [the analysis of discrete representations in neural models of speech processing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.05582).

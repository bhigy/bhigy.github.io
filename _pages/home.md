I am a postdoctoral researcher at the [Centre for Language and Speech Technology](https://www.ru.nl/clst/) at Radboud University (the Netherlands).

My research focuses on computational language learning from speech with a particular emphasis on weakly supervised approaches including visually-grounded learning.
I am also interested in interpretability of deep neural networks and  computational modeling of lanugage processing/acquisition by humans.

# News

* **11th November 2021:**
I will present a poster at the [BlackboxNLP workshop](https://blackboxnlp.github.io) about our recent work on [the analysis of discrete representations in neural models of speech processing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.05582).

* **15th September 2021:**
Today, I have officially started my new work as a postdoc in the [InDeep project](https://interpretingdl.github.io/) ðŸŽ‰.
I will work for 3 years with [Louis ten Bosch](https://www.ru.nl/english/people/bosch-l-ten) and [Tom Lentz](https://www.tilburguniversity.edu/staff/t-o-lentz) on the interpretability of deep models of speech processing.

* **May 2021:**
Our new edition of the [Zero Resource Speech Challenge](https://zerospeech.com/2021/index.html), featuring an audio-visual track, has been accepted as a NeurIPS competition.

* **September 2020:**
Our paper on [textual supervision for visually-grounded models of spoken language understanding](https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2020.findings-emnlp.244) has been accepted to the Findings of EMNLP 2020!

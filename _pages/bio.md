I achieved bachelor's degrees in Computer Science (2003-2006, first in my class) and Psychology (2005-2008) from Université Louis Pasteur, Strasbourg (France), followed by a master's degree in Cognitive Sciences (2008-2010, first in my class) from Université Lumières, Lyon (France).
From 2010 to 2015, I worked as a software engineer for a consulting company in Strasbourg.
After that, I moved to Genoa, Italy, where I worked as a research assistant and later as a PhD student within the iCub Facility at the Italian Institute of Technology (2015-2019).
In the first project, I got to explore haptic object recognition through manipulation, while my PhD thesis dealt with command recognition in the context of robotics and was done under the direction of [Giorgio Metta](https://www.iit.it/people-details/-/people/giorgio-metta) and Leonardo Badino.
I then worked as a postdoctoral researcher at the [Department of Cognitive Science and Artificial Intelligence](https://www.tilburguniversity.edu/about/schools/tshd/departments/dca) of Tilburg University (the Netherlands), investigating visually-grounded models of spoken language understanding with [Grzegorz Chrupała](https://grzegorz.chrupala.me) and [Afra Alishahi](https://afra.alishahi.name/). I also worked for a short period as postdoctoral researcher at the [Centre for Language and Speech Technology](https://www.ru.nl/clst/) at Radboud University(the Netherlands), working on the [InDeep project](https://interpretingdl.github.io). In collaboration with [Louis ten Bosch](https://www.ru.nl/english/people/bosch-l-ten/) and [Tom Lentz](https://www.tilburguniversity.edu/staff/t-o-lentz), I am trying to understand better how neural networks process speech to improve their performance.

Currently, I am working as a machine learning scientist at [Ava](ava.me) where I develop speech processing technology to enable live captioning for deaf and hard-of-hearing people.

                    <h4 class="service-heading">Short biography</h4>
                    <p class="text-muted text-justify">I achieved bachelor degrees in Computer Science (2003-2006, first in my class) and Psychology (2005-2008) from Université Louis Pasteur, Strasbourg (France), followed by a master degree in Cognitive Sciences (2008-2010, first in my class) from Université Lumières, Lyon (France). From 2010 to 2015, I worked as a software engineer for a consulting company in Strasbourg. I then moved to Genova, Italy, where I worked as a research assistant and later as a PhD student within the iCub Facility at the <a href=https://www.iit.it/>Italian Institute of Technology</a> (2015-2019). In the first project, I got to explore haptic object recognition through manipulation, while my PhD dealt with command recognition. I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at the <a href=https://csai.nl>Cognitive Science and Artificial Intelligence</a> department of Tilburg University, investigating visually-grounded models of spoken language understanding (<a href=https://www.esciencecenter.nl/projects/understanding-visually-grounded-spoken-language-via-multi-tasking/>the project webpage</a>).</p>

                    <p class="text-muted text-justify"> My current work focuses on spoken language understanding through visual grounding. A common approach is to train a deep neural network to map some visual input (image or video) and corresponding spoken description into a shared high-dimensional space, forcing the model to extract semantic information from both modalities. We are trying to improve the performance of such systems through multitask learning, e.g. by also asking them to answer questions about the images, transcribe the spoken description or match spoken descriptions in different languages. At the same time, we try to understand better how this models work by analyzing the learned representations.<br>

                    <p class="text-muted text-justify">In the long run, my interest revolve around autonomous and developmental learning. How can human babies learn so many skills in such a shorrt period of time? How much is genetically constrained and how much comes from learning? How did evolution produce such complex behaviors? And how can we use artificial systems to shed some light on this topics? These are the kind of questions that fascinate me. <br> I am particularly interested in the acquisition of language, one of the most advanced human capabilities. One of my current goals is to explore the use of deep neural network as models of language acquisition. Deep neural architectures are able to extract meaningful hierarchical representations from large scale data, which makes them good candidates to work on realistic data.</p>

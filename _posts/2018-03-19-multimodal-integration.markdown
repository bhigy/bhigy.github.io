description: This work has been conducted during the 1st year of my Master degree, while I was doing an internship at <a href="https://emc.univ-lyon2.fr">EMC lab</a>, University of Lyon 2, under the supervision of <a href="https://emc.univ-lyon2.fr/fr/equipes/equipe-cognition-outils-systemes/emanuelle-reynaud-611485.kjsp">Emmanuelle Reynaud</a>. During this project, we studied the hypothesis of a temporal synchrony between groups of neurons to explain multimodal integration. We also explored the possibility to use spiking neurons to model such phenomenons. <ul class="list-inline social-buttons">Resource (fr):<br><br><li><a href="files/memoireM1_bh.pdf"><i class="fa fa-file-pdf"></i></a></li></ul>
